#currency & converter

    These programs convert monetary currencies.  They use classes to accomplish this and each class has several
functions offering numerous abilities.  There are two test files, as well, that ascertain that the code is running accurately, as well as producing various outputs. In addition, both of the classes offer their own error reporting to ensure the user is getting back accurate data.
    The converter class offers a very useful function that will return any currency from any other currency. If
you would like to contribute to this class, one of the useful things that you ( the software community ) could
contribute would be adding a feature that automatically updates the exchange rates daily from a trust source.
